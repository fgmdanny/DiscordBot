# DiscordBot
Send messages through your Discord bot/application. 

This Python project entails the creation of a Discord bot using the discord.py library. Designed primarily for the support side of a professional Discord server, the bot establishes a connection to the server and actively monitors messages within a specified channel. Users interact with the bot by sending messages directly from the terminal, which are then relayed to the designated Discord channel

# The modules used in this project are:
```
- os: Allows interaction with the operating system, used for accessing environment variables.
- discord: Provides functionality for creating Discord bots and interacting with the Discord API.
- asyncio: Enables asynchronous programming, used for managing asynchronous tasks and event loops.
- dotenv: Facilitates loading environment variables from a .env file into the environment.
```
